//! Album-art processing for the animated background and accent colours.

//! Follows Kawarp's pipeline (MIT, Better Lyrics, used by better-lyrics-shaders):
//! tint the dark areas, then blur heavily. Kawarp does this on the GPU every frame;
//! here it runs once per track on a 64×64 image, so the per-frame shader is cheap.
//!
//! The palette pass reads the sleeve the way it looks, not the way its pixels
//! compute. HSV saturation runs sky-high on near-black pixels, so a black cover
//! with a faint warm cast would score its noise as "vivid"; lifting that for the
//! UI then floods the whole app with amber. So vividness only counts where colour
//! is actually visible, the pick is a bucket of every scoring pixel rather than
//! one, greyscale covers keep a greyscale palette, and both the accent lift and
//! the tint pull are bounded.
